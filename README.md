# Loan-Prediction-System

This system is used to make predictions for loan approval of target customers in a private company on the basis of various parameters/features. The prediction is calculated from the data obtained from Kaggle. It is a classification system which makes use of Machine Learining algorithms for the predict operation. In this notebook, three major ML algorithms are implemented:

* Logistic Regression
* KNN Classifier
* Naive-Bayes Classifier
